# Flight Tickets Price Prediction

Welcome to our Flight Tickets Price Prediction project repository! In this ML project, we aim to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates flight ticket prices. The ability to forecast ticket prices can significantly benefit both customers and the airline industry. For travellers, it provides an estimation of the cost, allowing them to plan their trips more effectively. For airlines, it helps with pricing strategies, revenue management, and understanding customer behavior.

## Business Problem
Air travel has become an integral part of modern life, and as the demand for flights continues to grow, so does the importance of predicting flight ticket prices accurately. Our goal is to create an efficient machine learning model that can help travellers plan their trips better and assist airlines in optimizing their pricing strategies.

## Data Import and Exploration
In this section, we will import the necessary flight ticket data. The dataset includes various features such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airline carriers, flight durations, and other relevant factors that may influence ticket prices. We will perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and prepare the data for analysis and model building.

## EDA, Feature Engineering, and Analytics
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the relationships between different features and the target variable, flight ticket prices. We will use visualization techniques to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within the data.

Feature Engineering plays a significant role in enhancing the model's performance. We will derive new features from existing ones, encode categorical variables, and normalize or scale numerical features to ensure they are optimal for model training. Additionally, we will perform analytics on the data, such as finding correlations between different attributes and analyzing the impact of different factors on ticket prices.

## Building the ML Model and Validation
In this final phase, we will construct a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict flight ticket prices based on the selected features. We will explore various regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression, to find the most suitable model with high predictive performance.

To evaluate the model's performance, we will divide the dataset into training and testing sets. We will use evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. To ensure the model's robustness, we may employ techniques like Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter tuning, preventing overfitting and enabling better generalization to new, unseen data.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we expect to have a reliable and accurate ML model that can predict flight ticket prices for given input parameters. This model can be used by travel websites, airlines, or customers to plan and make informed decisions regarding air travel. We hope that our work will contribute to a more seamless and efficient travel experience for everyone.
